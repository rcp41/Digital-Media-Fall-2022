Welcome to Rose's Repo

My Project will be a relaxing audio. Listeners can use this however they wish. I invision this to be a peaceful audio to listen to in times of stress or for assistance while sleeping.

While creating this piece, I found relaxing noices which brought me piece that I wish to relay to others. My favorite part of this project was finding a way to include the sound of windchimps, and editing them to fade in and out so that they were seemlessly implemented. 

Recording my own voice for this project was intimidating, as I am usually very self-conscious, but this helped me face those fears, and I am very proud of the final product.
